# Data Classification Policy

## Purpose
Ensure all information is classified according to sensitivity, supporting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Scope
Applies to all digital and physical company data, including emails, documents, databases, and media.

## Classification Levels
1. **Public** – Can be freely shared outside the company.
2. **Internal** – For internal use; not sensitive but not public.
3. **Confidential** – Sensitive business information (financial data, employee info).
4. **Restricted/Secret** – Critical data; disclosure could harm the company or clients.

## Handling Guidelines
- **Labelling:** Files must include classification in the header/footer.
- **Storage:** Confidential data encrypted at rest; Restricted/Secret on secure servers only.
- **Sharing:** Only share Confidential/Secret data with authorised personnel; encrypt emails.

### Real-World Example
- HR payroll reports labelled as Confidential; stored in an encrypted HR folder. Only HR and Finance managers can access.

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **Data Owners:** Assign classification, approve sharing.
- **Employees:** Follow handling rules.
- **IT Security:** Enforce encryption and access controls.
