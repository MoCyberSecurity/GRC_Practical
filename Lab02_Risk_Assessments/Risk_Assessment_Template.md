## Purpose
Identify and evaluate risks to IT systems, data, and operations.

## Scope

   - Example: CRM system, Payroll database, Employee laptops.

2. **Threat Identification**
   - Identify potential threats.
   - Example: Phishing, ransomware, insider misuse, hardware failure.

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Detect weaknesses.
   - Example: Outdated patches, weak passwords, lack of MFA.

4. **Risk Analysis**
   - Combine likelihood and impact to determine risk level.
   - Example:
     - Likelihood: Medium (3/5)
     - Impact: High (4/5)
     - Risk Level = Medium-High (12/25)

5. **Risk Evaluation**
   - Compare against organizational risk appetite.
   - Prioritize risks exceeding tolerance.

6. **Recommendations**
   - Mitigation, transfer, acceptance, or avoidance.
   - Assign owners and deadlines.
